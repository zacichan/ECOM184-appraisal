  This research evaluates the impact of Monte Carlo simulations on Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) outcomes in business cases. Traditional CBA methods often fail to account for the inherent uncertainties in real-world scenarios, potentially leading to suboptimal decision-making. By integrating Monte Carlo simulations, which model uncertainty and variability, this study aims to determine whether applying such simulations to existing CBAs would alter past business decisions. The research draws on a comprehensive literature review and addresses the lack of empirical studies applying Monte Carlo methods to historical business cases, the insufficient understanding of their influence on decision-making, and the need for a standardized methodology to incorporate these simulations into CBA practices. Using previously published business cases from various industries and time periods, the study conducts a comparative analysis between traditional and Monte Carlo-enhanced CBAs. The findings will offer insights into the benefits of probabilistic approaches in project appraisals, potentially establishing a more robust framework for evaluating project outcomes.

-   Sensitivity analysis explores how the expected outcomes of an intervention are sensitive to variations in key input variables.
-   It helps understand the impact of changing assumptions on project feasibility and preferred options.
:::

A key concept is the Switching Value - the value at which a key input variable would need to change to switch from a recommended option to another or for a proposal not to receive funding. Identifying switching values is crucial to decision-making.

::: {.callout-note title="Definition"}

Optimism bias is the demonstrated systematic tendency for appraisers to be over-optimistic about key project parameters, including capital costs, operating costs, project duration and benefits delivery.
:::

-   Adjust for optimism bias to provide a realistic assessment of project estimates.

-   Adjustments should align with risk avoidance and mitigation measures, with robust evidence required before reductions.

-   Apply optimism bias adjustments to operating and capital costs. Use confidence intervals for key input variables when typical bias measurements are unavailable.
